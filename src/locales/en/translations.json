    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Nuwault and how it works",
    "items": {
      "faq-1": {
        "question": "How does the deterministic password generation work?",
        "answer": "Nuwault uses SHA-512 cryptographic hashing to transform your keywords into consistent passwords. The same keywords will always produce the same password, making it deterministic and reproducible. This means you don't need to store passwords - just remember your keywords."
      },
      "faq-2": {
        "question": "Is my data safe? Do you store my keywords or passwords?",
        "answer": "Absolutely safe! All password generation happens entirely in your browser (client-side). Your keywords and generated passwords never leave your device or get sent to our servers. We have zero access to your data, ensuring complete privacy and security."
      },
      "faq-3": {
        "question": "Can I use the same keywords for different accounts?",
        "answer": "While you can, we recommend creating unique keyword combinations for each account. For example, use \"Phoenix + Gmail + 2025\" for Gmail and \"Phoenix + Banking + 2025\" for your bank. This provides account-specific passwords while keeping them memorable."
      },
      "faq-4": {
        "question": "What makes this better than random password generators?",
        "answer": "Unlike random generators, Nuwault's passwords are reproducible. You can regenerate the exact same password anytime using your keywords, eliminating the need for password storage. It combines the security of cryptographic hashing with the convenience of memorable keywords."
      },
      "faq-5": {
        "question": "How strong are the generated passwords?",
        "answer": "Nuwault's passwords are extremely strong! Using SHA-512 cryptographic hashing creates passwords with maximum entropy. The strength depends on your keyword choices and settings, but properly configured passwords achieve \"Very Strong\" ratings (75-100 points) and are virtually impossible to crack."
      },
      "faq-6": {
        "question": "Can I use this offline?",
        "answer": "Yes! Nuwault works completely offline since all processing happens in your browser. You can even install it as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your device for native-like offline access without internet dependency."
      },
      "faq-6a": {
        "question": "What if my browser cache is disabled?",
        "answer": "If your browser cache is disabled, the offline mode will not work properly. Nuwault requires browser caching (Cache API) to store files locally for offline access. To enable full offline functionality: <br><br><strong>Chrome/Edge:</strong> Settings â†’ Privacy and security â†’ Site Settings â†’ Cookies and site data â†’ Allow sites to save and read cookie data<br><br><strong>Firefox:</strong> Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ History â†’ Use custom settings â†’ Accept cookies from sites<br><br><strong>Safari:</strong> Preferences â†’ Privacy â†’ Manage Website Data â†’ Allow<br><br>Without cache, Nuwault will still work online but won't be available when you're disconnected from the internet."
      },
      "faq-6b": {
        "question": "How can I check if my cache is working?",
        "answer": "<div id=\"cache-status-info\">{{checkingStatus}}</div>"
      },
      "faq-7": {
        "question": "What if I forget my keywords?",
        "answer": "Since passwords are generated from keywords, forgetting keywords means losing access to those specific passwords. We recommend using memorable personal keywords and following consistent patterns. Consider writing down keyword hints (not the actual keywords) in a secure location."
      },
      "faq-8": {
        "question": "How do I create strong keyword combinations?",
        "answer": "Use diverse, personal keywords from different categories: names, places, hobbies, dates. Combine at least 2-3 keywords with 3+ characters each. Avoid dictionary words alone, common phrases, or easily guessable personal information like birthdays or SSN."
      },
      "faq-9": {
        "question": "Can I change password settings for existing keywords?",
        "answer": "Yes, but this will generate a completely different password. Changing length, character types, or keyword order creates new passwords. If you need to update settings for an existing account, make sure to change the password in that account first."
      },
      "faq-10": {
        "question": "Is Nuwault compatible with password managers?",
        "answer": "Absolutely yes! You can copy generated passwords directly into any password manager. This gives you the flexibility to use Nuwault's deterministic generation alongside traditional password management, providing both reproducibility and secure storage options."
